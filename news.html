    <h2 id="article-text">Museum of Science in Kyiv</h2>
    <p>The Museum of Science opened in Kyiv in October. It's the first interactive museum opened by the Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and organized by the GresTodorchuk agency. Children will finally stop getting bored, because the Museum of Science is a testing ground where you can ride a bike, scream, turn multicolored lights on and off, and move, test for strength, and conduct research on exhibits </p>
    <h2>What's so interesting?</h2>
    <p>A materials science exhibition is on the ground floor. There's an exhibit that shows the loading of fuel with ferromagnetic fluid into the fuel mechanisms. The lever activates the magnets, making the liquid pump into the tanks. There is also a sandbox on which the museum projects nine different biomes. You can build landscapes and change ecosystems. You can observe all this in real-time, i.e. causing downpours or direct lava flows from volcanic eruptions.</p>
    <h2>What is the visitors' reaction?</h2>
    <p>
        The museum is designed for children of primary school age, but there're many adults among the guests. You can see on their faces they are interested no less than children. The youngest visitors create an absolutely "anti-museum" atmosphere in the Museum. They run from exhibit to exhibit, yell loudly, turn strange containers with a variety of substances over.

        You can come here with children of any age. There're many visual effects that can interest even a baby, Maria, a museum employee, says. However, when asked how the museum is useful for adults, she said that she learned many things at work unknown to her:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><q>It's science. It surrounds us, and it's inside us. I've started thinking about things I've never thought about before. </q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>the other day, she rode the escalator to the subway, thinking about the mechanism that moves the stairs. </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><q>I wouldn't have even asked myself that question before!</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>No guides!</h2>

    <p>
        There're no classic tours in the museum, but they've got <q><em>interpreters</em></q> in each zone. These people help to find answers to various questions and help the kids understand why it's happening and not otherwise. But they don't explain directly and only determine the way so that even the youngest visitors could make a scientific discovery.

        Later on, the Museum <q><em>plans lectures</q></em> for adults and children.
    </p>
    <h2>Where else in the world are there museums of science?</h2>
    <p>One of the largest museums is in Canada, Ontario. There are five thousand exhibits, some of which have appeared in the Ukrainian museum. <strong>Almost every exhibit in the Museum of Science at the Expocenter of Ukraine was "collected" around the globe.</strong> Some of them came from the United States, Sweden, Canada. Most exhibits came from Poland, and some were developed in Ukraine.</p>
